## Daily Log

### 2025-07-27
- Created action plan document
- Created progress tracking document
- Analyzed test failure patterns
- Identified 394 failing tests across 51 files

## Blocked Items
None yet.

## Major Achievements âœ… 
- **Fixed Vue plugin duplication warnings** across ~26 test files
- **Eliminated 100+ console warnings** during test execution
- **Created robust test infrastructure** with centralized mocking
- **Fixed store mocking issues** (useProjectsMainStore, etc.)
- **Improved several component tests** (VulnList, ProjectsView, TreeChart)

## Next Actions (Phase 2)
1. Fix remaining component-specific test failures
2. Address prop validation and edge case handling
3. Optimize performance tests (DataTable component)
4. Continue systematic test fixing

## Notes
- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)**: âœ… COMPLETED
- Remaining test failures are primarily component-specific, not infrastructure issues
- Performance tests may need threshold adjustments based on realistic expectations
- Some tests may be failing due to outdated snapshots or incorrect expectations
